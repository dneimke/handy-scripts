# Readme

Handy-Scripts is a repository for storing useful scripts for doing repetitive tasks.  These tasks might include combining 2 videos, restoring an Azure database from a .bacpac file, or even something as simple as making a HTTP GET Request.

## Scripts
**FFMpeg**
* Convert-VideoSize - uses ffmpeg to compress a video to 1080p
* New-ClipsVideo - takes a [MatchShare](https://coding-tool.firebaseapp.com) data payload and uses it to generate clips from a source video file

**SportsCode**
* Move-Events - allows user to modify a SportsCode events file using targeted queries

**Databases**
* Import-FromAzureExport - imports an export of an Azure database into a LocalDb instance
