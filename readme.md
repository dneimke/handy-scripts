# Readme

Handy-Scripts is a repository for storing useful scripts for doing repetitive tasks.  These tasks might include combining 2 videos, restoring an Azure database from a .bacpac file, or even something as simple as making a HTTP GET Request.

The aim is to organize the repository in a sensible way and to write scripts using existing PowerShell standards and guidelines.
